Weight
The most accurate way to determine any bike’s weight is to have 
your local dealer weigh it for you. Many brands strive to list 
the lowest possible weight, but in reality weight can vary 
based on size, finish, hardware and accessories. All Giant 
bikes are designed for best-in-class weight and ride quality.
